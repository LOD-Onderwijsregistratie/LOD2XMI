# XSD for validating the input

This is a place to share XML Schema Diagrams (XSD) to validate the input for XSLT transformation. The reason for doing this is that several the RDF/XML serialization of a  datamodel can be obtainend in multiple ways. There is as we start  no way to know if the output in every case is similar.  Providing  an XSD will help solving issues when changing.

* XSD to match output of http://www.easyrdf.org/converter
This is a conversion of the turtle (or actually trig) file originally created with a inhouse Verlocity script using Magic Draw.

* XSD to match rdf4J sparql endpoint
The relevant linked open data triples are selected and contructed directly on a rdf4J endpoint in the rdf4J serialization.

* XSD to match Kadaster Data Platform endpoint
