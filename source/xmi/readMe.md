## XMI-files resulting from XSLT transformation

The result of XSLT transformation is a XMI-file that can be imported in UML-tools for system development.  This directory contains the obtained results.

* XSL Output-snipper-uml

  This result is created using the model-samples in 
  - https://github.com/LOD-Onderwijsregistratie/RDF2XMI2UML/tree/master/source/examples

  And it is tested with Enterprise Architect.  

*  XSL Output-snipper-mim

   The same model-samples but this time with MIM-stereotypes and MIM-coretypes added. To do: add MIM obligatory tagged values.

*  XSL Output-RIO-uml

This model describes the RIO-data that is actually published as linked data. See als:  http://lod.onderwijsregistratie.nl.  Note: This linked data model does not have the same pattern described in this github  yet. This wil be changed in a next release.
