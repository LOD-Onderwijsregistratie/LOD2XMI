This directory contains  a small example of a datamodel in turtle serialization (M1 in the 4-layer model). This
file can be imported in tools that do rdf. It works as as shacl-graph. This means that it can be used to validate a data-graph with 
instances from reality (M0 in the 4-layer model). A small M0-example is also added to experiment with, maybe using https://shacl.org/playground.

What follows is a description of the rdf constructions used to descibe a M1-model. This is the M2-layer in de 4 layer model. It is created with the requirement that its constructions also can be expressed in the metamodel for MIM (M2-layer).
