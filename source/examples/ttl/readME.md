## Original Turtle-file

This directory contains the original example of a datamodel (M1 in terms of the 4-layer model by OMG ) in turtle serialization. This
file can be imported in tools that do rdf. It works as as shacl-graph. This means that it can be used to validate a random datafile with 
instances from reality (M0). A small M0-exampled is also added to experiment with, maybe using https://shacl.org/playground.
